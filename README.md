# iPhoneX-Unity-UI-Canvas
A Canvas + Panel that shows where your UI can be in the iPhone X 

This contains a prefab that has the following: 

Canvas
  - Panel
  - Notch_Left
  - Notch_Right
  
They are anchored correcty and the Canvas resolution is set to the iPhone X resolution. This will help understand how to make and use UI's in Unity with the new iPhone. 

Note: If you do not add UI objects as children to the "Notch_Right" or "Notch_Left" GameObjects then it will work in iPhone 8 and below.
